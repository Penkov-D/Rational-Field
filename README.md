# Rational Field for C++
<br/>
This project composed mainly of two files - "Rational.cpp" and "Rational.h". <br/>
Together they create a class 'Q' that gives the ability to make arithmetic calcultaion and rational numbers. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the supported operations:

```
1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4
1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4
1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8
1/2 / 3/4 = 2/3
1/2 % 3/4 = 1/2

+1/2 = 1/2
-1/2 = -1/2
~1/2 = 2/1

1/2 to int = 0
1/2 to float = 0.5

1/2 == 3/4 : 0
1/2 != 3/4 : 1
1/2 < 3/4  : 1
1/2 > 3/4  : 0
1/2 <= 3/4 : 1
1/2 >= 3/4 : 0

1/2 == 1/2 : 1
1/2 != 1/2 : 0
1/2 < 1/2  : 0
1/2 > 1/2  : 0
1/2 <= 1/2 : 1
1/2 >= 1/2 : 1
```
